# Simon Says Game using JQuery

This project is a web-based version of the classic **Simon Game**, built using **jQuery** and **JavaScript**. The goal is to replicate an increasingly complex sequence of button presses, testing the userâ€™s memory and focus.

## ðŸš€ Features

- **Random Color Sequence Generation**  
  Each round, a random color is added to the sequence from a predefined set: `["red", "blue", "green", "yellow"]`.

- **User Input Handling**  
  Detects and tracks user clicks on color buttons. The input is compared with the correct sequence.

- **Animations & Sounds**  
  Each color button plays a sound and has a visual animation when activated.

- **Answer Validation**  
  After every user input, the app checks if it matches the generated pattern:
  - If correct, the next color is added.
  - If incorrect, a "Game Over" sound plays and the game resets.

- **Game Over Logic**  
  The screen flashes red and the title changes to indicate failure. The player can restart the game by pressing any key.

- **Game Instructions Modal**
  A modal window appears when the game loads, displaying instructions on how to play. Once closed, the game begins.
